OpenFst Tools

	This is a collection of useful tools put together for use with the OpenFst (http://www.openfst.org) toolkit.
	The collection contains some code found on the OpenFst forum. Currently considering offering additional tools found in lextools.
	Where the forum provided information, a link to said forum article is provided.

License

	This code was licensed under the Apache license that OpenFst is released under.

Dependencies

	Assumptions:
		I assume you're building with gcc/g++.
	Deps:
		libdl and libfst

	libdl should be installed already, if it's not, install your OS "developer" packages
	libfst is the OpenFst library, you can get it at http://www.openfst.org

Build Instuctions

	Edit the Makefile variable EXTRA to match your system configuration. This means you'll have to add any custom 
	-I and -L flags so gcc/g++ know where to find the proper include and library files.

Contact

	If you have any recommendations, ideas, or comments, please feel free to contact the google code page related to this collection.
